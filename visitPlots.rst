===========

Initial Data
------------
Initially the data in a number of precursor collections was studied while the
plots were being developed. During this investigation an offset in the
photometry was found as shown in :numref:`magOffset`. This was then corrected for
in the later processing.

.. figure:: /_static/scatterPlotVisit_CircAp12_sub_PS_meas_scatter_HSC_i_HSC-I_1228_hsc_rings_v1_u_sr525_visitPlots_20211112T023306Z.png

This issue was fixed before the main processing began.

Large Scale Processing
----------------------
Once the initial data had been studied the large scale processing started.
Plots were made of this data at the visit level. Plots for one, representative,
visit are included here.

This plots show that the offset seen before has been fixed and don't show up
any other obvious issues. Plots studying the ellipticity were also made and
some examples are given below.

More plots are available for a variety of visits and can be viewed through the
plot viewer in the u/sr525 collections.
